# Triangle of Life - Robot specification
This repository contains just the robot specification of my Triangle of Life project,
in Google's Protobuf format. Tools are included to generate header files, a shared library
and Python includes. Tools are also included to convert between supported formats.

This is still a work in progress, no working code is present yet.
